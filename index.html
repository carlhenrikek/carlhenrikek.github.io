<p>
My name is <b>Carl Henrik Ek</b> and I am a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Bristol, UK and a Docent in Machine Learning at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

Learning is the task of associating a new phenomena to previous knowledge. Knowledge is the capability of providing structure to the environment. In the field of machine learning we try to build methods that are capable of learning directly from data. The fundamental aspect of learning is assumptions, being the realisation of knowledge, the science of machine learning is concerned with how to formulate assumptions into mathematical models (modelling) and how to related them to observed data (inference). My research focus spans both these areas, in specific I am interested in how we can specify data efficient and interpretable assumptions that allows us to learn from small amounts of data. Most of my work is focused on Bayesian non-parametric methods and in specific Gaussian processes.

<b>Short Bio</b>
Before joining Bristol I was an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. I did my postdoctoral research at University of California at Berkeley. My PhD is from Oxford Brookes University. I spent two years of my PhD at the University of Manchester where I was a research assistant in the Machine Learning and Optimisation group and a further six months at University of Sheffield as a visitor in the Machine Learning group. My supervisors during my PhD where Professor Neil Lawrence and Professor Phil Torr and for my post-doc Professor Trevor Darrell. Prior to this I was at University of Bristol where I was working together with Dr. Neill Campbell on Computer Vision in specific related to natural image statistics. My undergraduate degree was an MEng degree in Vehicle Engineering from KTH in Stockholm.
